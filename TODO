John
    CG threaded function (half functionnal only)
    The alpha value from slider is not enough to change image, need eric

Eric
    move linalg.Utils to linalg.LinalgUtils (idea: each Utils should be called ClassUtils except mitiv.utils)

Discussion
    Add .classpath file to solve the probleme of src package (not a perfect solution)
    Should we create interface for regul/optim (ask many others questions)
    (John) In functions 1D as 2D do we ask width, height or only one and we guess the other ?
    Retro compatibility with java 6: ie no switch on string
    Should we update old functions with vectors
