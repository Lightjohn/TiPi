    Be careful of your variable name/sysout -> Verify all your code

    -Need to verify depth aberation and jacobian with Fereol
    -cross only the pupil, not the whole images?
    -put an even zernike

    Add .classpath file to solve the probleme of src package (not a perfect solution)
    Should we create interface for regul/optim (ask many others questions)
    (John) In functions 1D as 2D do we ask width, height or only one and we guess the other ?
